# ThesisCode

Contains an implementation of Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar, and two new signature schemes based on UOV

## choosing parameters:

In the parameters.h file one can specify which algorithm has to be used to preform a test, as well as how many key pairs and signatures have to be produced

The parameters that are specific for each of the three algorithms are defined in the files "UOVClassicParameters.h" , "UOVTinF2Parameters.h" and "UOVHashParameters.h"
